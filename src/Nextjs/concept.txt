Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR). It provides a way to build React applications with better performance and SEO out of the box, and it offers features like automatic page routing, dynamic routing, and API routes.

Key Concepts in Next.js:
Server Components vs. Client Components:

Server Components are rendered on the server, and the result is sent as HTML to the client. They don't have client-side interactivity but are faster as they reduce client-side JavaScript overhead.
Client Components are interactive React components rendered in the browser and handle client-side interactivity like handling events or managing local state.
In Next.js 13+, you can explicitly define components to be server or client by adding use client at the top of a file for client components.

How Next.js Manages Applications:

Pages are created in the pages directory, and Next.js automatically handles routing based on the file structure.
Layouts and App Directory (introduced in Next.js 13) help organize applications into modular components with shared layouts between pages.
Data Fetching Methods like getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, and getStaticPaths control how data is fetched and rendered.
Advantages of Next.js:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Improves SEO and page load performance.
Static Site Generation (SSG): Generates static HTML at build time, which can be served by a CDN for faster delivery.
API Routes: Allows you to create backend APIs within your Next.js application.
Image Optimization: Optimizes images automatically with built-in image components.
Automatic Code Splitting: Ensures that each page only loads the JavaScript it needs.
File-Based Routing: Simplifies routing by generating routes based on the folder and file structure.




Summary of Key Differences and Advantages:
Feature	Next.js 12	Next.js 13
Server Components : 	Not available, all components run on the client : 	Available, reducing client-side JS payload

Client Components  : 	All components are interactive and require JS :	Marked with use client only when necessary

App Directory :	Not available, only pages/ routing :	Introduced for modular layouts and routing

Layouts	Global or nested in individual components	Supports shared layouts across pages automatically
Data Fetching	getServerSideProps, getStaticProps	More flexible with server and client components
JavaScript Payload	Larger as everything is bundled to the client	Reduced by splitting server-side and client-side components
