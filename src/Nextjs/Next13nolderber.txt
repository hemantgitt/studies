Differences Between Next.js Older Versions and Next.js 13+:

App Directory (Next.js 13):

New folder-based approach that makes it easier to manage layouts and page structure.
app/ directory is introduced for organizing pages and layouts more modularly compared to the pages/ directory.
Server Components (Next.js 13):

Introduces React Server Components, enabling components to render server-side by default, reducing client-side JavaScript payload.

Streaming and Suspense (Next.js 13):

Streaming allows content to progressively render on the page, improving the user experience.
Suspense for server-rendered data fetching allows you to load parts of the page lazily while still rendering the shell of the page.
Image and Font Optimization:

Automatic font optimization to preload fonts, improving performance.
Improved image optimization through better compression and lazy loading.
Middleware and Edge Functions:

Middleware allows you to execute logic before a request is completed, enabling things like redirection, authentication, and modifying responses.
Edge Functions allow executing code closer to the user at the edge, improving performance.
