axios in React

axios is a promise-based HTTP client used for making network requests in React (or any JavaScript environment). It simplifies the process of making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., requests and handling responses.

Key Concepts:

1: Promise-Based: axios returns a promise that resolves with the response object or rejects with an error.
2: HTTP Methods: You can use various methods like .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete().
3: Interceptors: You can intercept requests or responses to modify them (e.g., adding authentication tokens).
4: Error Handling: You can handle errors using .catch() or try...catch for async/await syntax.
