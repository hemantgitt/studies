useState in React

useState is a hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with two values: the current state and a function to update it.

const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

Key Concepts:

1: State Variable: The first element of the array is the current value of the state.
2: State Setter Function: The second element is the function used to update the state.
3: Initial State: The state can be initialized with a value or function.
